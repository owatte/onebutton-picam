Python class to interact with a raspberry Pi with a picam and a pull button


## One button camera based on raspberry Pi and PiCam.

The OneButtonPiCam class provides a simple framework to interact with a PiCam,
just using a single button.

The OneButtonPiCam follows a very simple workflow, pressing button changes
the state. Each state is associated with a RGB led color value and optionnaly,
 an action.

* state 0 : READY = waiting for button key press
* state 1 : PROCESSING = doing action with picam (eg. taking picture or video)
* state 2 : POST-PROCESSING = doing post-processing treatments (optional)
* -> back to state 0

The OneButton PiCam does not do anything : it is intended to be used in new
python class created with inheritance mechanism and overwritting the
`do_processing()` and `do_post_processing()` methods.

## Todo

Replace the use of time.sleep() in the run() method by a time counter to improve button usability and reactivity.
